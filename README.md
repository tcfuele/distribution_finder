# Distribution Finder

This is a continuation of my masters project. It will provide proof of concept for estimation of the distribution function of a non-equilibrium hydrodynamic fluid cell. The function finding will take place via learning the momentum distribution from the transport picture of particles, where we can also compute hydrodynamic state variables. We will arrive at a mapping from non-equilibrium state variables, such as shear and bulk stress to possible distribution function.

I will continue to work on this in my free time, connecting the pure parameter scan with learning via neural networks. So this project is under construction and will undergo heavy changes in the next weeks.

### TODO:

### Data creation:

- Maxwell Jüttner Data Sampler ✓
- Plot distribution function ✓
- Distort momentum space to incorporate either Bulk or shear stress transformation
- Plot distribution function again
- Calculate non-equilibrium quantities

### Learning:

- Find suitable NN to handle data
    - translational invariance of energy-momentum tensor --> CNN?

### Cleanup:

- Clean README for release state
