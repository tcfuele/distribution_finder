# Distribution Finder

This is a proof of concept that it is possible to estimate the distribution function of a non-equilibrium hydrodynamic fluid cell via learning the momentum distribution from the transport picture.

### TODO:

### Data creation:

- Maxwell Jüttner Data Sampler
- Plot distribution function
- Distort momentum space to incorporate either Bulk or shear stress transformation
- Plot distribution function again
- Calculate non-equilibrium quantities

### Learning:

- Find suitable NN to handle data
